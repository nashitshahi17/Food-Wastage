        <h2 style= font-size:50px;>About</h2><p><br> The aim of the research study is to make an overall analysis of food wastes, its various types and their causes, composting and different processes involved, various methods and techniques practiced in different countries, and overall benefits and advantages/disadvantages of food waste composting. There are mainly two broad categories of food waste viz., organic food waste arising due to human consumption at home, restaurants and inorganic waste which occurs at upstream and downstream levels involved in food manufacturing process etc. Food waste are categorized in to various types namely production, processing, distribution, acquisition, preparation, and consumption<br>
<br><figure>

        </figure>
The evil consequences of food waste are due to large amount of energy losses occur when food is dispensed, comprising the energy needed for production and distribution of food, processing wasted food, as well as the energy seized inside the food itself. However certain types of food waste are unavoidable and hence composting process is adopted to marginalise evil aspects of the former. Composting is a process carried out under controlled biological maturity at aerobic conditions, where organic matter of animal or vegetal origin is decomposed to materials with shorter molecular chains, more stable, hygienic, humus rich, and finally beneficial for the agricultural crops and for recycling of soil organic matter. Compost helps to return organic materials to the soil and keeps them out of landfills and waterway and overall can also be used as a mulch, a liquid “fertilizer,” or integrated into the soil. The agents of composting are divided in to primary, secondary, and tertiary level of consuments.<br>
<br>

Ideally there are 2 phases of composting in which organic matter undergo change known as Degradation and Maturation. Various methods of composting for home, agricultural or industrial etc with specific mention to latest methods like NADEP are clearly highlighted for better understanding with the multiple parameters involved in composting process also being given adequate attention. The research study categorized the best composting practices adopted in various countries and gives cue in selecting most economically viable ones in current use with their benefits.

            Food wastage is a significant problem that affects millions of people around the world. Every year, tons of edible food are thrown away, while many go hungry. It's time to raise awareness and take action.

<section id="Causes">

<h2>Various Causes of Food Waste</h2><br>
<h1 font-size=50px>Discussed below are the significant causes of food waste.
</h1>

<br>

<ul><li><h1> Lack of Appropriate Planning
</h1>One of the top contributors to food wastage is because of a lack of appropriate planning on the consumer’s part.<br>
<br>


Sometimes people buy lots of food without appropriately planning when and how the food will be prepared for consumption.<br>
<br>
Coupled with the contemporary schedules of work and appointments, people, therefore, tend to change food preparation plans or fail to remember to use them on time.
<br><br>


<center><img src="tasteless.webp" ></center><br>

food wastage
At times most people are not in control, leading to the expiry of the foods, after which they are wasted.<br>
<br>
But that’s not the only way improper planning contributes to food wastage. You see, again, due to a lack of appropriate planning, people have poorly prepared food that doesn’t taste great. It all ends up as waste.
<br><br></li>


<li><h1> Purchase and Preparation of Excess Food
</h1><br>Most of the time, food is wasted by purchasing, preparing, or serving more than we need. When this happens, the excess food on the plate or cooking pot goes to waste.
<br><br>
Alternatively, the partially used food is sometimes put at the back of the fridge and never reused. The same applies to excess purchases that pass their expiration dates and therefore look, taste, and smell terrible. At the end of it all, all the excess ends up as waste food.<br></li><br>


<li><h1> Errors in Industrial Processing and Keeping up With Food Safety Policies</h1><br>
<br>Another significant driving factor for food wastage is the protocol on food safety. The food safety protocols give no room for error in industrial processing or any other compromise that diminishes the final food product quality.<br>
<br>
As such, the confusions and errors that occur during industrial food processing mean that all food items that don’t meet the set standards are wasted.
<br><br>
Food processing companies must comply with high food safety regulations and thus establish no error margins.
<br><br>
In complying with the food safety policies, the companies in the sector waste lots of food since any small error means the food will be rejected, even if it’s simply due to imperfection in appearance or shape.
<br><br>
Overcooking, production trials, packaging defects, trial runs, and wrong sizes and weights result in imperfection and the eventual rejection of the foods.
<br><br>


<li><h1> Managerial, Financial, and Technical Constraints</h1><br>
This is mainly a challenge contributing to food wastage in developing countries.
<br><br>
The wastage occurs due to the constraints of improper management, inadequate finances, and technical difficulties in harvesting methods, storage, and cooling problems.
<br><br>
This is due to adverse weather conditions, processing, packaging, infrastructure, and marketing systems.
<br><br>


<li><h1> Over-preparation of Food in Restaurants, Hotels, and the Foodservice Industry</h1><br>
Most restaurants, hotels, and the food service industry alike have a tendency to over-preparing/producing food.<br>
<br>
While the intention is good, especially in anticipation of high customer volume and the ability to not run out of the menu, over-preparation often leads to the wastage of all the unsold food.<br>
<br>
DC Central Kitchen, committed to reducing food wastage, points out that overproduction in the food service industry is the leading cause of food wastage.
<br><br><center><img src="Food-waste.webp"></center>
Excess food in restaurants
Since the food service operations cannot quantify the amount of food consumed on average, the kitchens keep producing amounts thought to be enough but most of it is unnecessary.
<br><br>
Besides, some managers believe producing food in large batches minimizes costs, but in actual fact, it results in more waste than cook-to-order preparation or cooking in small batches.
<br><br>



<li><h1>over Merchandizing and Ordering in Food Stores and Supermarkets</h1><br>
Over-merchandizing food items and products in retail centers, wholesale markets, and supermarkets often results in food loss.<br>
<br>
Food service operations are habitually more focused on over-merchandizing in food stores and supermarkets by using beautiful and attractive displays, thereby creating the idea of abundance in an attempt to promote sales and customer satisfaction.
<br><br>
The overlooked aspect of over-merchandizing is the reason for this increased food waste. When people buy more than needed, the excess will often end up in the trash bin.
<br><br>
Over-ordering also leads to the expiry of food staff with a limited shelf life as some will remain unsold.
<br><br>



<li><h1> Consumer Behavior
</h1><br>Customers have different preferences, which highly influence purchasing behavior on food items.
<br><br>
Notably, the consumer behavior on focus here is the tendency of having a keen insight for good judgment, resulting in those who only prefer fresh vegetables and fruits and the restrictive must-display for shelf-life dates.
<br><br>
Such consumer behavior, more often than not, contributes to the wastage of food as most of the food items may remain on the shelves till expiry.
<br><br>
Also, such tendencies may force food service operators in restaurants and hotels to maintain extensive menu options and high-end services while assuring consistency, leading to food wastage.

<h2>Effects of Food Waste</h2>
<br>Food waste’s consequences are severe: It depletes natural resources, degrades the environment, and constrains efforts to increase access to healthy diets for low-income populations, including others.<br><br>

Some of the effects of food waste include the following;
<ol>



<li><h1 font-size:10px;> Biodiversity Loss</h1>
Food wastage impacts biodiversity loss at a global level. Farmers have increasingly invaded wild areas to maximize agricultural yields in search of more fertile lands, leading to the extinction of different species.
<br><br>
This is because practices such as slash and burn, deforestation, and conversion of wild areas into farmlands have destroyed the natural habitats for birds, fish, mammals, and amphibians.
<br><br>
biodiversity loss
Agricultural practices such as mono-cropping have also compounded biodiversity loss.
<br><br>
The mass rearing of livestock for consumption and the use of pesticides in crop production has also significantly contributed to;
<br><br><center><img src="deforestation.webp" ></center>
Nitrogen, phosphorous, and chemical pollution in streams, rivers, and coastal waters, thus affecting marine life.
<br><br>




<li><h1> Wastage of 1/3 of the World’s Fertile Land Regions</h1><br>
According to research, the produced but unconsumed food accounts for approximately 1.4 billion hectares, constituting almost 1/3 of the planet’s agricultural land.
<br><br>
By looking at this from a well thought analytical angle, the world is wasting 30 percent of the world’s fertile land, which could be used for other meaningful purposes such as environmental research.</li>
<br><br>
<center><img src="appetizer-avocado-bread-breakfast.jpeg"></center><br>


<li><h1> Blue Water Footprint</h1><br>
The volume of water used in agricultural food production is immense. Therefore, if 30 percent of all the food produced goes to waste, then it means that more than 30 percent of freshwater used in the production and processing of food also goes to waste.
<br><br>
This contributes to the blue water footprint, which refers to the amount of consumed surface and groundwater resources that go to waste.
<br><br>
Precise estimations indicate that food wastage is responsible for the wastage of nearly 250 cubic kilometers (km<sup>3</sup>) of water. This wastage is equivalent to thrice the volume of Lake Geneva.
<br><br>
It is also affirmed that throwing out a kilogram of beef wastes 50,000 liters of water in meat production. Similarly, 1000 liters of water is wasted if one glass of milk is poured down the drain.




<br><br></li>
<li><h1> Increased Carbon Footprint and Acceleration of Climate Change</h1><br>
The food produced and later goes to waste is estimated to be equivalent to 3.3 billion tons of greenhouse gas emissions, accelerating the impacts of climate change. Research also states that food waste is the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.<br><br>

The reason for this is the consideration for the energy wasted and the primary use of fossil fuels in food production, including processing, cooking, and transportation to various consumer markets worldwide.
<br><br>
Moreover, the methane gas produced at landfills by food thrown out as waste further aggravates climate change and global warming.
<br><br>
<li><h1>Economic consequences</h1>
In addition to the environmental impacts, food wastage also results in direct economic costs. FAO’s report estimates the economic losses associated with food wastage are about $750 billion dollars per annum.

<h2 style= font-size:45px;>FOOD WASTAGE IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES</h2>
<br>

<p style=font-size:25px;>Food waste produced annually in selected countries worldwide 2020</p><br>
Published by Ian Tiseo, Feb 6, 2023<br>
<figure>  <img src="20825.jpeg" alt="WASTE FOOD" align="right" width="500" height="300">

        </figure>


 <p><br>China and India produce more household food waste than any other country worldwide at an estimated 92 million and 69 million metric tons every year, respectively. This is unsurprising, considering both countries have by far the largest populations globally. Food waste has often been thought to be concentrated in wealthier countries, however, in terms of food waste per capita, there are similarities between developed and developing countries. It is estimated that per capita food waste production is highest in Western Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.<br><br>
</p>


<p style= font-size:25px;>Sources of food waste<br><br></p><p>
The global population produced approximately 931 million metric tons of food waste in 2019. This represented roughly 17 percent of total food made available. Household food waste was the main source of food waste that year, accounting for 61 percent of the total. The second main source of food waste was the foodservice sector.
</p><br>


<p style= font-size:25px;>Why is food waste such a problem?</p><br><p>
Food waste has many societal impacts that affect all of us. It not only costs the global economy hundreds of billions of dollars every year and depletes resources, but it also harms the environment and contributes to the climate crisis. When food waste is dumped at landfill sites it rots and produces large volumes of methane – a potent greenhouse gas. Food waste accounts for an estimated nine percent of global food system greenhouse gas emissions, which in 2015 totaled 17.9 billion metric tons of CO2 equivalent.<br>

        <h2>Solutions</h2><br>
        <p>
            <h1>Proposed Solutions to Food Waste</h1><br>

<strong>Globally</strong>, reducing wasted food has been cited as a key initiative in achieving a sustainable food future. Sustainable Development Goal 12 addresses responsible consumption and production, which includes two indicators to measure (in order to ultimately reduce) global food loss and food waste. <br><br>

In the U.S, on June 4, 2013, the Department of Agriculture and Environmental Protection Agency launched the U.S. Food Waste Challenge, calling on entities across the food chain, including farms, agricultural processors, food manufacturers, grocery stores, restaurants, universities, schools, and local governments. <br> The goals are to:<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Reduce food waste by improving product development, storage, shopping/ordering, marketing, labeling, and cooking methods.</l1><br><br>
<li>Recover food waste by connecting potential food donors to hunger relief organizations like food banks and pantries.<br><br>
</li><li>Recycle food waste to feed animals or to create compost, bioenergy, and natural fertilizers.
</li></ul><br><br><br>
On September 16, 2015, both agencies also announced for the first time a national food loss and waste goal, calling for a 50% reduction by 2030 to improve overall food security and conserve natural resources.<br><br>

The National Resources Defense Council issued a summary paper providing guidelines on how to reduce waste throughout the food production chain.  The following are some focal points:
<ol>

<li><strong>State and local governments</strong> can incorporate food waste prevention and education campaigns, and implement municipal composting programs. Governments can provide tax credits to farmers who donate excess produce to local food banks. Proposed bills are currently in place in California, Arizona, Oregon, and Colorado.</li><br>

<li><strong>Businesses such as restaurants, grocery stores, and institutional food services</strong> can evaluate the extent of their food waste and adopt best practices. Examples include supermarkets selling damaged or nearly expired produce at discounted prices, or offering “half-off” promotions instead of “buy-one-get-one-free” promotions. Restaurants can offer smaller portions and donate excess ingredients and prepared uneaten food to charities. Schools may experiment with concepts that allow children to create their own meals to prevent less discarded food, such as with salad bars or build-your-own burritos.</li><br>
<li><strong>Farms</strong> can evaluate food losses during processing, distribution, and storage and adopt best practices. Farmers markets can sell “ugly” produce, which are discarded, misshapen fruits and vegetables that do not meet the usual standards for appearance. Farms can sell fresh but unmarketable produce (due to appearance) to food banks at a reduced rate.</li><br>
<li><strong>Consumers</strong> can learn when food is no longer safe and edible, how to cook and store food properly, and how to compost. <br><br>

"Food Recovery Hierarchy" graphic by the U.S. Environmental Protection AgencyThe Environmental Protection Agency provides the “Food Recovery Hierarchy” graphic to explain ways to handle excess food.  From the most preferred at the top of the pyramid to the least preferred at the bottom tip, the methods include:<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Source reduction: Earliest prevention by reducing the overall volume of food produced</li><br>
<li>Feed hungry people: Donating excess food to community sites</li>
<br><li>Feed animals: Donating food scraps and waste to local farmers who can use them for animal feed</li>
<br><li>Industrial uses: Donating used fats, oils, and grease to make biodiesel fuel</li>
<br><li>Composting: Food waste that is composted to produce organic matter that is used to fertilize soil</li>
<br><li>Landfill/Incineration: A last resort for unused food</li>

        <h2>15 quick tips for reducing food waste  </h2>
        <p>
            For many people in the world, food waste has become a habit: buying more food than we need at markets, letting fruits and vegetables spoil at home or taking larger portions than we can eat.<br>

These habits put extra strain on our natural resources and damage our environment. When we waste food, we waste the labour, effort, investment and precious resources (like water, seeds, feed, etc.) that go into producing it, not to mention the resources that go into transporting and processing it. In short, wasting food increases greenhouse gas emissions and contributes to climate change.<br>

<br>It’s a big problem. In fact, worldwide, tonnes of edible food are lost or wasted every day. Between harvest and retail alone, around 14 percent of all food produced globally is lost. Huge quantities of food are also wasted in retail or at the consumer level.
<br><br>

The part of food that is lost from harvest up to, but not including, the retail level is called food loss. The part wasted at the consumer or retail level is referred to as food waste. We make this distinction to address the root causes of this problem, a problem that everyone from farmers and producers to customers and shop-owners can help end.<br>
<br>
Reducing food loss and waste is essential in a world where millions of people go hungry every day . When we reduce waste, we respect that food is not a given for the millions of people who go hungry every day.<br><br>

It’s up to us to change our habits to make not wasting food a way of life!<br>
<br>
Here are some easy actions you can take to re-connect to food and what it stands for:<br><br><ol>
<li><h1>Adopt a healthier, more sustainable diet</h1>Life is fast-paced and preparing nutritious meals can be a challenge, but healthy meals don't have to be elaborate. The internet is full of quick healthy recipes that you can share with your family and friends</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Buy only what you need</h1>Plan your meals. Make a shopping list and stick to it, and avoid impulse buys. Not only will you waste less food, you’ll also save money!</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Pick ugly fruit and vegetables</h1>Don’t judge food by its appearance! Oddly-shaped or bruised fruits and vegetables are often thrown away because they don’t meet arbitrary cosmetic standards. Don’t worry - they taste the same! Use mature fruit for smoothies, juices and desserts.</li><br><br>
<li><h1> Store food wisely</h1>Move older products to the front of your cupboard or fridge and new ones to the back. Use airtight containers to keep open food fresh in the fridge and ensure packets are closed to stop insects from getting in.</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Understand food labelling</h1>There’s a big difference between “best before” and “use-by” dates. Sometimes food is still safe to eat after the “best before” date, whereas it’s the “use-by” date that tells you when it is no longer safe to eat. Check food labels for unhealthy ingredients such as trans fats and preservatives and avoid foods with added sugar or salt.</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Start small</h1>Take smaller portions at home or share large dishes at restaurants.</li><br><br>
<li><h1> Love your leftovers</h1>If you don’t eat everything you make, freeze it for later or use the leftovers as an ingredient in another meal.</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Put your food waste to use</h1>Instead of throwing away your food scraps, compost them. This way you are giving nutrients back to the soil and reducing your carbon footprint.</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Respect food</h1>Food connects us all. Re-connect with food by knowing the process that goes into making it. Read about food production and get to know your farmers.</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Support local food producers</h1>By buying local produce, you support family farmers and small businesses in your community. You also help fight pollution by reducing delivery distances for trucks and other vehicles.</li><br><br>
<li><h1> Keep fish populations afloat</h1> Eat fish species that are more abundant, such as mackerel or herring, rather than those that are at risk of being overfished, like cod or tuna. Buy fish that has been caught or farmed sustainably, such as eco-labelled or certified fish.</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Use less water</h1>

We can’t produce food without water! While it’s important that farmers use less water to grow food, reducing food waste also saves all the water resources that went into producing it. Reduce your water intake in other ways too: fixing leaks or turning off the water while brushing your teeth!
</li><br><br>
<li><h1> Keep our soils and water clean
</h1>
Some household waste is potentially hazardous and should never be thrown in a regular rubbish bin. Items such as batteries, paints, mobile phones, medicine, chemicals, fertilizers, tires, ink cartridges, etc. can seep into our soils and water supply, damaging the natural resources that produce our food.
</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Eat more pulses and veggies
</h1>
Once a week, try eating a meal based on pulses or ‘ancient’ grains like quinoa.
</li><br><br>
<li><h1>Sharing is caring
</h1>
Donate food that would otherwise be wasted. For example, Apps can connect neighbours with each other and with local businesses so surplus food can be shared, not thrown away.
</li><br><br>
















        </p><p>
<h1>Benefits of Less Food Waste</h1>
<ul><br>
<li>Cost savings on labor through more efficient handling, preparation, and storage of food that will be used.</li>
<br><li>Cost savings when purchasing only as much food as needed, and avoiding additional costs of disposal.</li>
<br><li>Reduced methane emissions from landfills and a lower carbon footprint.
Better management of energy and resources, preventing pollution involved in the growing, manufacturing, transporting, and selling of food.</li><br>
<li>Community benefits by providing donated, untouched, and safe food that would otherwise be thrown out.</li><br>
